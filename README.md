# Calendar Forge

Any calendar solution - from online to paper - can be used to help remember appointments and tasks. But a Calendar is way more than this. Calendar is a powerful tool when using it to craft a better future. It can be used as visualization (for the path). It can be used as a reward (completing the steps). It can be a friendly reminder to stay on the path (that once you have decided on this given path).

> A calendar should be a tool to help forge the best future, not just set appointments. 

This tool provides features to facilitate forging the best schedule (the best future). Some of these are:

- [x] Save entirely on the browser
- [x] Highly customizable descriptions.
- [x] Recurring Events.
- [x] Tasks with user-defined time.
- [x] Linked Tasks.
- [x] Event templates.
- [ ] Editor Mode (A place designed to help craft the best schedule).
- [ ] Event Branching.
- [ ] Random Notifications.
- [ ] Access from multiple devices.
